Hi, I am pursuing an M.Tech in Microelectronics and VLSI Design (Department of Electronic System Engineering) at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. I am a Texas Instruments scholar working on mmWave radar project in the NeuRonICS Lab, IISc. I completed B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Technology, Lucknow in 2020. I am familiar with C, Python, MATLAB, Verilog, and VHDL. I have done a couple of projects involving ML, embedded systems, and digital system design using FPGA. My fields of interest include applications of machine learning and embedded systems.


I am a learning enthusiast, a good listener, and a music lover. I enjoy watching web series, dancing, cycling, and playing badminton. I am also a Green-1 belt in Taekwondo.
